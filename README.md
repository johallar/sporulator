## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running this application locally, ensure you have the following installed:

### Required Software

- **Python 3.11 or higher** - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Git** - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+)
- **Memory**: Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for large images)
- **Storage**: At least 2GB free disk space

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fungal-spore-analyzer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### UV

Install UV

#### Install Deps

```bash
uv sync
```

### 4. Create Configuration Directory

Note: This should already exist, make any edits needed
Create the Streamlit configuration directory and file:

```bash
mkdir -p .streamlit
```

Create `.streamlit/config.toml` with the following content:

```toml
[server]
headless = true
address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 5000

[theme]
base = "light"
primaryColor = "#b67feb"
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Start the Application

```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000
```

### Access the Application

Once started, the application will be available at:

- **Local URL**: http://localhost:5000

The terminal will display both URLs when the application starts successfully.

## üìã Usage Instructions

### 1. Image Source (Step 1)

- **Upload Image**: Use the file uploader to select microscopy images (JPG, PNG, TIFF)
- **iNaturalist Integration**: Enter an observation ID to load images directly from iNaturalist
- **Image Requirements**: High-contrast, well-focused microscopy images work best

### 2. Calibration (Step 2)

Choose one of the calibration methods:

#### Manual Entry

- Enter the pixel-to-micrometer conversion ratio manually
- Useful when you know the exact scale from microscope settings

#### Auto-detect Micrometer Divisions

- Upload an image with visible micrometer scale divisions
- The system will automatically detect and calibrate the scale
- Works best with clear, high-contrast scale markings

### 3. Analysis (Step 3)

- **Configure Detection Parameters**: Adjust area filters, circularity, and shape constraints
- **Choose Detection Method**: Traditional computer vision or YOLO deep learning (if model available)
- **Enable Watershed Separation**: Automatically separate touching spores
- **Run Analysis**: Process the image and view detected spores
- **Review Results**: Use the interactive spore legend to select/deselect individual spores
- **Export Data**: Download results as CSV or Excel files

## üîß Configuration Options

### Detection Parameters

- **Area Range**: Minimum and maximum spore size (in pixels or micrometers)
- **Circularity Filter**: Shape constraint (0.0 = any shape, 1.0 = perfect circle)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Length-to-width ratio limits
- **Edge Exclusion**: Remove partially visible spores at image borders

### Watershed Separation

- **Aggressiveness**: Conservative, Balanced, or Aggressive separation
- **Smoothing**: Gaussian smoothing for improved separation
- **Erosion Cycles**: Morphological preprocessing for connected regions

### Export Settings

- **Measurement Units**: Micrometers, millimeters, or pixels
- **Statistical Format**: Include mycological summary statistics
- **Image Overlays**: Export annotated images with measurements

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

#### OpenCV Installation Problems:

```bash
# If opencv-python fails to install:
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install opencv-python-headless opencv-python
```

#### Memory Issues with Large Images:

- Resize images to maximum 2048x2048 pixels before upload
- Close other applications to free memory
- Consider using a machine with more RAM

#### Port Already in Use:

```bash
# Try a different port:
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8080
```

### Application Issues

#### No Spores Detected:

- Check image contrast and focus quality
- Adjust area range filters (try wider ranges)
- Reduce circularity filter threshold
- Ensure proper calibration

#### Too Many False Detections:

- Increase minimum area threshold
- Tighten circularity filter (closer to 1.0)
- Enable edge exclusion
- Adjust aspect ratio limits

#### Calibration Problems:

- Verify scale bar visibility and contrast
- Check reference distance accuracy
- Try manual calibration as fallback
- Ensure image contains clear scale markers

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Processing:

- Reduce image size before upload
- Disable watershed separation for faster processing
- Use traditional CV method instead of YOLO
- Close browser tabs and other applications
